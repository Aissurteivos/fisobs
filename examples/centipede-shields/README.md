CentiShields is a plugin for Rain World.

- When a centipede's shell breaks off, it sometimes becomes an item you can pick up and use as a shield.
- The shield blocks rocks, spears, and certain creature attacks/grabs. Larger shields are better at what they do.
- Red centipedes will drop shields that are larger, more numerous, and more durable than those of orange centipedes.
- For sandbox mode, orange shields are unlocked when adult orange centipedes are unlocked, and red shields are unlocked when red centipedes are unlocked.
